# OpenWrt LuCI Theme - Material Components

[![Build Status](https://github.com/LinkedMink/luci-theme-material-components/actions/workflows/build-main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LinkedMink/luci-theme-material-components/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build-main%22)

This repo builds an OpenWrt LuCI theme package based on [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web). This project attempts to integrate contemporary web application development tools and workflows (NodeJS, NPM, Webpack, ESM, TypeScript, etc.) into OpenWrt's 
build system while also providing a fresh look and feel.
